Hello, this is a project about trying to make Blockus in 4 dimensions.
There is already a functional version written on MatLab(HyperBlockus.m), and i'm trying to translate and improve it in C.

You can compile my project by doing: "gcc -o hyperblockus main.c" or just "make" then do "./hyperblockus"

Do whatever you want with this project, including modifying and improving it, I would appreciate if you credit me, I'm Yann Toussaint, but it's ok if you don't.
